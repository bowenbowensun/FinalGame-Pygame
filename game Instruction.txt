I signed up to partner with Thomas Rochman, but we had a disagreement with what we need to do.
My idea is basically too complex for a partner to like so we ended up working on different stuffs.
So please grade our work separately.

The Game is straightforward, left right key to move, S to shoot and SPACE to jump. There are also
meticulously designed hints in the game telling you how to play.

Standard Features:
1.User Input
2.Graphics , 90% of my graphics are completely original! And this is a graphic-heavy game. Hope you enjoy my hand-drawn work.
3.Game start and end.

4. Animation: Characters designed frame by frame!
5. Enemies: who even knows how to fire a gun! and drive a tank!
6. Collectables: There are guns and vehicles you can pick up. Who doesnâ€™t like weapons?
7. Scrolling level: I created a tiny 2-D world. Trees, clouds, towers.
8. Timer: there is no explicitly timer display, but internally the story of game runs according to the timer.
9. Health meter: basic feature~
10. Sound Effect: You will find the tank and flying boot sound refreshing!
